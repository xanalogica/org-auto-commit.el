;;; org-auto-commit.el --- Auto-commit Org buffers with policy control -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
;; Version: 0.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (magit "3.0.0"))
;; Keywords: org, git, convenience
;; URL: https://github.com/yourusername/org-auto-commit

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package defines a minor mode `org-auto-commit-mode` which automatically commits
;; Org-mode buffers under user-defined conditions. It supports idle-based commits,
;; predicate-based filtering, and optional post-commit hooks (like AI processing).
;;
;; To enable this mode, use:
;;
;;   (require 'org-auto-commit)
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-auto-commit-mode)
;;
;; Customize via `M-x customize-group RET org-auto-commit RET`.
